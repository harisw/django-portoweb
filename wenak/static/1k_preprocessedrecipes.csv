69,Chicha Peruana,"Chicha (corn beer). Chicha is made in South and, to a lesser extent, Central America. Unlike African opaque beer, it is not brewed commercially, but instead is made and served in what sound to me like wee tiny brewpubs. An abbreviated version is also made in people's kitchens. Chicha is consumed whilst still fermenting and so is low in alcohol. It is often spiced and may also be served with fruit.  With Bill's help and a little patience, a friend and I recently completed a batch. This was a very interesting and satisfying endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used. Every step of the process was very simple, and I highly recommend attempting this at home. My second crop of corn is about to come in and the results were good enough that I will be doing this again in the near future.","""1 1/2  lbs    jora (malted corn)"",""1   lb    piloncillo cone (akin to brown sugar)"",""1 (1/4  ounce) package   Nottingham dry yeast""",1,"'Procedure: Mash for 90 minutes at 160°F.', 'We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with curacao/coriander, the other with allspice/cinammon). We would rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is seriously imparied.', 'Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we found we had only 3lbs of jora.', 'Rather than readjust (the OG would have been more appropriate at ~1.045 in any case), we added more sugar, a course of action that was inspired by homebrewed Weizen as much as anything else. The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle. Be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body.', ""Once the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes."", 'Specifics:  OG: 1.055  FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with.', 'Facil (easy) - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor.', 'Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off.', 'Traditional - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling.', 'Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom.', ""This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens."", 'Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles.', 'Also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge.

76,Alfredo Sauce,"This is my son's favorite meal. I make it with shrimp for him for his birthday every year. GREAT for company because it is so easy and yet taste wonderful!

1878,Indian Onion Relish,"I am trying to find out what ingredients are in the onion stuff that every Indian restaurant I've ever been to gives you to have with your meal. It's obviously diced onions, and it is a bright or deep red, sometimes even an orange color.  It's usually spicy hot to varying degrees, depending on the restaurant.  Thanks in advance!

2758,Maultaschen (Swabian Pockets),"It has been said that 'Maultaschen' were originally   invented in order to allow Swabians to keep eating   meat during Lent by concealing it beneath the pasta   shell and amidst the spinach filling from the eye of   the parish priest (if not the omniscient Deity   Himself).  The following recipe is typical but far   from definitive, especially where the ingredients   for the filling are concerned.  Feel free to use   whatever you have on hand or whatever your fancy (or   your conscience) dictates.

My other ideas are to 1) pack into a measuring cup and turn out onto a green salad, or 2) add to pasta and Italian dressing for a pasta salad, or 3) Add as a topping on a hearty sandwich, like roast beef and pumpernickel.

""A few tweaks in the ingredients in chocolate chip cookies can dramatically change the outcome.  Want a crispy thin cookie?  Use an all-butter dough. Because butter melts more quickly than shortening in a hot oven, the dough spreads.  For a puffy cookie, use shortening to keep the dough from flattening.   Get a softer cookie by sweetening it only with brown sugar. Combine brown with granulated sugar for a crispier cookie.

Fold 1/3 of the dough over filling, overlapping about half way; fold the remaining 1/3 of the dough so it overlaps the first 1/3. Use a gentle hand when overlapping the filling so that when it bakes the filling will have room to expand. Shape the rolls into crescents, using thumbs and fingers. When forming the crescents the edges might curl up slightly. Do not try to smooth out the dough. To do so would not allow the dough to expand and become flaky.', 'Always place filled kieflies on a cool, ungreased cookie sheet. Bake no more than 1 sheet at a time.

5330,Helen's Crab Stuffed Potatoes,"This week's recipe is another local award-winning recipe from the Annual Hard Crab Derby in Crisfield, Maryland. Many of our recipes are derived from the local community and are featured in this annual derby event. Some history of the Hard Crab Derby, held every Labor Day, follows:  ""The first derby was held fifty-two years ago in 1947. This first derby was a simple, uncomplicated affair by today's standards. It consisted of a number of crabs being unceremoniously dumped in the center of a circle which was painted on the street in front of the Post Office.  From these humble beginnings the National Hard Crab Derby has grown into one of Crisfield's most successful festivals. The derby has changed locations many times and is now held on the grounds of the Somers Cove Marina. The race format has also been altered. Instead of the crabs being dumped in the center of a circle, they each have their own ""starting gate"". Once this gate is opened the crabs scurry down a platform to the finish line. In addition to the regular crab derby there is now a governor's cup race in which the governors of the states which constitute our union enter a crab contestant. Entries from Hawaii (1967) and Alaska (1968) have even won this race. The first cooking contest was held in 1965. This popular event was won in that year by Nina Coons of Marion Station. Nina entered a delicious crab casserole as her award winning recipe. Because of its superior cooking facilities, the contest has been held in Crisfield High School. Winning chefs have been mainly from Maryland with a few from Delaware and Pennsylvania.""","""6       baking potatoes"",""1   lb    backfin crab meat"",""1   cup    sour cream"",""1/4  cup    green pepper, chopped "",""1/4  teaspoon    pepper"",""1/4  cup    cheese, finely grated "",""1   cup    milk"",""1 1/2  teaspoons    Old Bay Seasoning"",""1/4  cup    mayonnaise"",""1/4  teaspoon    salt"",""4       egg whites""",4,"'Preheat oven to 400 degrees.', 'Bake potatoes 45 minutes or until done.

7169,Pancakes,"This is one of my adopted recipes. I adopted it towards the end of 2005 because it brought back many happy memories. I have altered it just a little by using melted butter in place of the shortening and by mixing the egg, milk & butter together before adding to the dry ingredients.  I have also added how to cook them for those new to cooking :)  My Mother In Law used to make pancakes for my girls when they were young as a treat when we visited. They always had them with lemon juice (she had a wonderful large lemon tree) and sprinkled them with sugar.  :)
The cooking time is approximate.
